**Drag 'n' Drop with Image** is Mike Stevens's adaption of the [Adapt-dragndrop](https://github.com/danielstorey/adapt-dragndrop) *presentation component* created by Dan Storey.

A drag and drop with images component, both the drag and drop spots can have images. There can also be dummy answers and works with multiple correct items. This component also has bounce back option without submit and feedback buttons. If the bounce back feature is enabled you can only have one correct item, otherwise if not you can have multiple correct items.
